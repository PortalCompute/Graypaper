# Services
PCONs can be flexible in their implementation, with Portal offering both generalized and specialized oracle networks. A general purpose oracle network allows for smart contracts to offload arbitrary programs/functions to the oracle network to execute via a general purpose runtime. Specialized compute services allow for highly optimized functions to be executed by the oracle network, faster and cheaper than if the same function were executed on a general purpose runtime. As there are tradeoffs in both cases, we aim to support both to include as many use-cases as possible for our users.
