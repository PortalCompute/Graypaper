# Technology
> Blockchain has revolutionized industries but has constantly been fighting to scale. At Portal, we offer a compute oracle service to help. Our privacy-preserving compute helps scale adoption by protecting the data of users. Our performant off-chain compute allows smart contracts to scale well beyond what is possible on current chains. 
By moving more and more computation off-chain and using the smart contract for settlement,  Portal can even help scale the throughput of the underlying chain.
