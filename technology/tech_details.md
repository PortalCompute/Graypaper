# Technology
> Blockchain has revolutionized industries, but has constantly been fighting to scale. At Portal, we offer a compute oracle service to help. Our privacy-preserving compute helps scale adoption by protecting the data of users. Our performant off-chain compute allows smart contracts to scale well beyond what is possible on current chains. If more and more computation is moved off-chain and the smart contract is used for settlement, then Portal can even help scale the throughput of the underlying chain.
