# Tokenomics

## The Portal (PRTL) Token:
>The PRTL token is the sole asset that allows developers to access the Portal Compute Oracle Network (PCON). The Portal token will have a max supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens upon release. These tokens will be distributed as follows: 30% to investors, 25% to the Community Reserve, 20% to the team, 10% to partnerships, 10% to marketing, and 5% to advisors. These tokens will follow a 9-month cliff period, followed by an 18-month linear vesting period, whereby tokens will be distributed on a monthly basis.

## How PRTL works
>Each request made to the network will need to be coupled with a specific fee in PRTL tokens. This fee is calculated based on the size of the requested compute job, along with the networkâ€™s availability of nodes. The PRTL token is used in two ways: 1) Nodes are awarded PRTL upon fulfilling a request and 2) a percentage of the PRTL submitted to the network is burned out of circulation. This burning mechanism allows PRTL to be deflationary, ensuring that all token holders are holding an asset that increases in scarcity as network-use increases. Dapp developers using PRTL will need to ensure their applications have access to enough PRTL to service requests, which will lead many Dapps integrated with our service to stock up on PRTL tokens and use them as compute activity increases on their platforms. We envision PRTL having a high Daily Trading Volume, as our customer base grows, due to the high demand and strong feedback we've recieved for our services.

## The Portal Governance Token
>We plan to issue a Portal Governance Token (PGT) to facilitate voting for fee proposals and project direction via the Portal DAO. As we increase decentralization, the need for a democratic process for fee distribution will be needed. The PGOV token will be issued to PRTL nodes as a way for allowing the direction of the project to be determined by the decentralized network of nodes that service our customers.
