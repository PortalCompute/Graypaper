# Motivation

## Where Modern Web2 Applications Fail
> Imagine you want to plant a garden but do not own the necessary land. Instead, you are offered the opportunity to plant your garden on someone else's land. You accept this offer and plant your garden but soon realize the implications of being a part of another's land. The rules are created and modified without your input. You have little control over how your garden will be treated now or in the future. The landowner can decide what you can and cannot do with your garden, restrict access to it, charge you expenses with minimal notice, and censor activities that infringe on their arbitrary garden policies. It can be said that you, the garden “owner”, effectively own nothing and are at the whim of the landowner.

> Such is the life of software developers and customers on many web2 platforms. A developer using cloud computing services is not guaranteed privacy or security from a service provider. A company may alter financial policies with short notice, terminate compute instances without warning, mishandle data, and abuse access to servers. For customers using services from a web2 company, autonomy is even more minimal. The leaking, resale, and misuse of personal data is so rampant and commonplace that governments worldwide have stepped in to enact more consumer protection laws. However, these changes are painfully slow, and technology companies know that users often have few alternatives: they can choose to sacrifice the rights to their data or forfeit access to the application.

## Planting The Seeds For Web3
> At Portal Compute, we want to make building world-class, decentralized applications (Dapps) as affordable, secure, and democratic as possible. Web2 services are affordable and easy to use, but their infrastructure comes with a large set of trust assumptions, resulting in services that are centralized, subject to censorship, and lack transparency. Web3 developers create services that combat these issues but must sacrifice costs, complexity, resources, and often privacy. These tradeoffs severely limit and prevent the use-cases and adoption of decentralized applications.


## Make The Blockchain Practical
> Despite strides in the markets, the numbers show that attracting mass adoption for web3 services and Dapps is still very far away. We are nowhere near the number of Dapp users needed to replace even basic web2 applications. Identifying the barriers preventing the adoption of Dapps is necessary in reaching a world where users have autonomy over the services they rely on.

>We believe that the limited computational power of smart contracts and their lack of privacy prevent the creation and adoption of Dapps. To address this, **Portal Compute** offers an interoperable oracle service for performing scalable off-chain computations with privacy. New and existing Dapps can harness oracle services to empower smart contracts with compute resources and previously impractical capabilities. Smart contracts can receive verifiable randomness from off-chain without breaking the bank. Even GPU-powered AI for applications like facial recognition are possible at practical speeds.

>In terms of data privacy, we're learning in web2 that data hoarding and mishandling have quickly led internet users to become victims of mass privacy violations. Consumers are too familiar with receiving notifications informing them that their personal data was leaked from one of the many applications essential in their daily lives, from social media to tax filing services. Every year, the industry loses billions of dollars to data leaks. Surveys from Oxford Economics show people are losing faith in technology’s ability to solve world problems, citing Big Tech's massive influence over customer data as a significant factor. 

>Portal Compute's oracle services provide a different experience and business model by offering end-to-end encryption for all compute requests. If this model is normalized, it can solve fundamental problems plaguing user privacy by allowing applications to run on user data without ever needing to expose the underlying data. This model allows for a significant shift in how applications and companies use and share data. Portal Compute provides a safer compute solution for data handling that is more sustainable and resilient than today's services.
