# Motivation

## Where modern web2 applications fail
> Imagine you wanted to plant a garden, but you did not own the necessary land. You are instead offered the opportunity to plant your garden on someone else's land. You accept this offer, and begin to plant your garden, but you soon realize you face a series of complications due to the land owner's rules. The rules are created and often modified without your input, and you have little control over how your garden will be treated now or in the future. The land owner can decide what you can and cannot do with your garden, they can restrict access to the garden, charge you expenses with minimal notice over your garden, and censor activities that go against their arbitrary garden policies. It can be said that you, the garden “owner”, effectively own nothing and are at the whim of the land owner.

> Such is the life of software developers and customers on many web2 platforms. A developer making use of cloud computing services isn't guaranteed privacy or security from a service provider. A company may alter financial policies giving short notice, terminate virtual machines without warning, mishandle data, and abuse access to servers. For customers using services from a web2 company, autonomy is even more minimal. The leaking, resale, and misuse of personal data is so rampant and commonplace, that governments around the world have stepped in to slowly enact more consumer protection laws. However, these changes are painfully slow, and technology companies know that users often have few alternatives. They either sacrifice their rights to use a greatly needed service, or these users are cut off from financial, social, technological markets.

## Planting the seeds for web3
> At Portal Compute, we want to make access to building world-class, decentralized applications as affordable, secure, and democratic as possible. Web2 is affordable and easy to use, but compute on web2 also comes with a large set of trust assumptions. Web2 services are centralized, subject to censorship, and lack transparency. While a developer who wants to use compute services on web3, often makes sacrifices in terms of affordibility, capabilities, resources, and often must leave user data unencrypted. These features make certain decentralized applications currently impossible on web3 and limit potential impact and use cases.

## Make the blockchain practical
>Despite major strides in the markets, the numbers show that attracting mass adoption for web3 services and decentralized applications is still very far away. We are nowhere near the number of dapp users needed to replace even basic applications that exist on web3. If we want blockchain to be able to reach the audiences that many projects pitch across their marketing and envision in white papers, we'll need the ability to better identify these barriers.

>We believe a key limitation is in the computation of smart contracts, as well as the unencrypted, public nature on most blockchains. Portal is an interoperable oracle solution that can provide an immediate layer of both encryption, while also providing off-chain compute that is cost-effective and secure. These features allow for new decentralized applications, utilizing compute resources that can allow Portal to enable usecases as basic as blockchain's most affordable VRF, to unlocking complex GPU-powered AI for facial recognition.

>In terms of data privacy, we're learning in web2 that data hoarding and mishandling has quickly led Internet users into being victims of mass privacy violations. Consumers are too familiar with receiving notifications informing them their personal data was leaked when using everyday applications: from using social media, to even completing their taxes. Every year, the industry loses billions of dollars to data leaks, and surveys from Oxford Economics show people are losing faith in technology’s ability to solve world problems, citing Big Tech's massive influence over customer data as a major factor. 

>Portal's oracle service provides a different experience and business model by offering end-to-end encryption for all compute requests. If this model is normalized, it can solve fundamental problems plaguing user privacy, by allowing applications to run on user data without ever needing to expose the unencrypted data. This would allow for a major shift in how applications and companies use and share data. Portal Compute provides a safer compute solution for data handling that is more sustainable and resilient than today's services.
