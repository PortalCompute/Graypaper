# Introduction
> At Portal, we believe in a future where technology is transparent and reliable yet still keeps our data safe. We believe in a future that's technologically efficient yet does not settle for irresponsible centralization.

> Blockchain has emerged as a potential solution, providing insight into a future where we no longer need to trust central parties to perform services with integrity. In only a few short years, the field revolutionized finance and continues to proliferate, with new and creative use cases for smart contracts being conceived every day.

> Unfortunately, there are limitations: all data is public by default, and computations are intentionally throttled to ensure timely consensus. These hurdles make smart contracts very limited, costly, and inflexible.

> Portal overcomes these limitations by providing an oracle service for off-chain computations, empowering smart contracts with fast, scalable, private, and decentralized compute. Portal helps Dapps reach their potential by enabling computations that scale well beyond what is possible today, including integrating with the latest trends in GPU computing to perform complex AI and machine learning tasks.

> At Portal, we unlock new possibilities in DeFi, GameFi, SoFi, healthcare, and beyond. Whether it's running a complex trading algorithm on Solana, encrypting an NFT on Ethereum, or generating a tailored newsfeed for a decentralized Twitter on Polkadot â€“ we democratize compute for all Dapps. Help build the future of web3 and technology as a whole, one centered around transparency, privacy, and accessibility, with Portal.
