# DeFi Yield-Farming
> ![DeFi Yield-Farming](../gifs/defi_yield.gif)
> Yield-farming algorithms are constrained in their complexity due to the limitations of smart contract compute. These Dapps can utilize state-of-the-art AI when doing yield-farming via AI oracle inference requests, unlocking a massive untapped potential to optimize trading strategies. 

> AI can be used for price prediction, from tokens to virtual real estate, and Dapps can easily add this functionality with oracle requests.

> Automatic Market Makers (AMMs) can use ML models to decide prices instead of constant formulas.

# DeFi Insurance
> ![DeFi Insurance](../gifs/defi_insurance.gif)
> Insurance Dapps lack the compute power to run sophisticated risk assessment models. AI oracle requests can be used to verify insurance claims are valid, screen applicants, and decide on optimal investments.
