# Recommender Systems
> ![Workflow](../gifs/recommender_sys.gif)
> Many services include a core feature known as a recommender system or a system that suggests content to users. The immense amount of user-generated data and AI algorithms to process this data have carved out an important role for AI recommender systems in web2. This has given AI a powerful role in influencing user decisions, as recommender systems are often the most fine-tuned products in applications spanning from e-commerce to social media.

> For some web3 Dapps to be competitive or even on par with their web2 counterparts, it is essential that they adopt the same AI recommender systems. However, existing recommender systems are centralized black boxes that do not protect user data.

> Using Portal's AI oracle services, the recommender systems serving up the content of the metaverse and decentralized social media platforms can be built responsibly, preventing the societal problems we face today (i.e. [Cambridge Analytica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica)). 

## Contrast With Current Systems
> Currently, recommender systems are the essential but opaque content recommenders that decide what news we see, what movies we watch, and even where we eat. We have seen problems where biased datasets resulted in [hiring algorithms that were sexist against women.](https://becominghuman.ai/amazons-sexist-ai-recruiting-tool-how-did-it-go-so-wrong-e3d14816d98e) 

> We have also seen how perverse incentives in algorithms have flooded our newsfeeds with fake news, exacerbating polarization. Without accountability, we are forced to trust that these recommender systems are responsibly constructed and trained.  

> Fortunately, Portal provides the necessary tools to prevent these systemic issues and build responsible recommender systems.



## Implications for Metaverse
> The metaverse encompasses a wide range of spaces in web3. With verifiable AI, we can enhance what's capable in the metaverse, what's fair, and can integrate a much more rich and creative metaverse space. We can apply many of the ideas here to the metaverse in more specific contexts, from verifiable AI in gaming to procedural content generation.
