# Fractionalized Ownership and AI Marketplaces
> It is not only possible to represent a model as an NFT, but this can be taken a step further and the NFT can be fractionalized. This enables multiple entities to own a share of the model, which we'll refer to as an AI-share.

## Primary Market
> Users can request AI oracle requests to receive inference from this model in exchange for PAI. The owners of this model are rewarded PAI dividends based on their percent ownership of AI-shares. 

## Secondary Market
> The existence of AI-shares enables a secondary market to emerge. Here, traders can speculate on different AI, and can exchange AI-shares via DEXs. Since AI-share holders are awarded dividends whenever the AI is used for inference, the traders are speculating on how often an AI will be used in the future. This creates competition around useful AI, and thus incentivizes the training of useful AIs. 

### Example: Recommender Systems 
![](../gifs/ai_market.gif)
> For example, a marketplace can form solely around recommender systems. Each can specialize in different kinds of content. Traders can speculate on the medium and category of content that is trending/emerging (i.e. photos of cats OR videos of dogs). They can also speculate on what they think the best recommender system is within the category is that will maximize their dividends. 

> This creates a path to monetization for recommender system developers without relying on the ad-based business model. If content is also decentralized, then this significantly lowers the barrier of entry for new social media platforms to quickly gain traction. With more options for content providers and recommender systems, users would be able to frictionlessly transition between platforms, breaking up the monopolies we see today.
