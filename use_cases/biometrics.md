# Non-Custodial Biometric Analytics
>![](../gifs/facial_recognition.gif)
> Non-custodial biometric analytics and authentication can be implemented to protect user data while providing valuable identity services (i.e. facial recognition to unlock a wallet). 

> For example, a user can perform an inference oracle request containing an encrypted image of their face. Portal will perform facial recognition using a pre-trained model. The oracle response can contain the probability that the face is a match, which can trigger a smart contract action (i.e. approve a transaction if the percentage exceeds a threshold).

> This framework can be applied to other biometrics analytics (i.e. fingerprints or retinal scans).
