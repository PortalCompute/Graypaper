# Proof of AI
> Whenever Portal submits an inference oracle response to a smart contract, this could be thought of as a **proof of AI**. The existence of such proof serves as tamper-proof evidence that an AI was used. By scanning back through the blockchain's history, one can count all of the times that the AI was used.

## Accountability
> A proof of AI can serve as an essential tool in scenarios where it is valuable or essential to audit how often AI is being used. Cases where AI assists in life-changing decisions are in need of such accountability.  

## Applied to Hospitals
![Workflow](../gifs/proof_of_ai.gif)
> Machine learning has been used in hospitals to help detect the early stages of a life-threatening complication called [Sepsis](https://www.theverge.com/c/22927811/medical-algorithm-explainer-sepsis-risk-watch). When given a series of patient data, the model predicts how likely a patient is to be septic. Since Sepsis is difficult to identify, this model provides doctors with life-saving second opinions. 

> If hospitals access the model via Portal oracle requests, they will produce on-chain evidence that they used the Sepsis model. 

> There are many possible implications for this. Hospitals can accrue reputation: high AI usage can signal that they provide patients with additional diagnoses. Hospitals can also be held accountable for their AI usage. For example, it is now possible to prove that all patients received equal AI screenings.
