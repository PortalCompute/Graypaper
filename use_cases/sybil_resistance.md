# Sybil Resistance 
> ![](../gifs/sybil_resistance.gif)
> Sybil attacks are a significant problem with blockchains and still serve as a roadblock for certain practical use cases of Dapps. A Sybil attack is when an adversary creates multiple identities to gain a larger share of influence on a network. These attacks threaten a core feature of decentralization in most blockchains. For example, multiple fake identities can influence decision-making in the voting process of a DAO. Depending on the smart contract, a Sybil attacker can obfuscate their activity, generate the activity of non-existent users, or collect rewards intended for only one user. For certain Dapps, this presents a limitation to their services. In the web2 world, this problem is commonly addressed using combinations of CAPTCHAs, e-mail/mobile verification, or requiring certain KYC dataâ€“ sometimes even asking users to submit government-issued identification. In the web3 world, many of these methods are inherently at odds with principles of decentralization and privacy.

## Proof of Personhood
>Proof of Personhood is one method of defense against a Sybil attack, where a verification service can determine whether a person is a human or not. This service could determine that one person should receive one equal vote in a DAO or only be allocated one share of rewards from a yield-farming Dapp.

> Portal allows for a more complex Proof of Personhood function to be built into smart contracts. These applications can use privacy-preserving AI to do the necessary verification a contract requires. The results of this verification can be posted on the ledger to boost the reliability and integrity of the proof's verification process. There is already immense interest in the space for this technology, with a few major use cases being democratic voting, representation in DAOs, interactions in the metaverse, distribution of DeFi rewards, and building decentralized social media user bases.
