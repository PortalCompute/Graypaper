# Sybil Resistance 
![](../gifs/sybil_resistance.gif)
> Sybil attacks are a major problem with blockchains and still serve as a roadblock for certain practical use cases of Dapps. A Sybil attack is when an adversary creates multiple identities in order to gain a larger share of influence on a network. These attacks threaten a core feature of decentralization in most blockchains. For example, multiple fake identities can be used to influence decision making in the voting process of a DAO. Depending on the smart contract, a Sybil attacker can obfuscate their own activity, generate activity of non-existent users, or collect rewards intended for only one user. For certain Dapps, this presents a limitation to their services. In the web2 world, this problem is commonly addressed using combinations of CAPTCHAs, e-mail/mobile verification, or requiring certain KYC dataâ€“ sometimes even asking users to submit government-issued identification. In the web3 world, many of these methods are inherently at odds with principles of decentralization and privacy.

## Proof of Personhood
>Proof of Personhood is one method of defense against a Sybil attack, where a verification service is capable of determining whether a person is a human or not. This service could determine that 1 person should receive 1 equal vote in a DAO or 1 person should be allocated only 1 distributed amount of rewards from a yield-farming Dapp.

>Advances in AI have contributed to the creation of bots that can bypass many software CAPTCHAs. Portal allows for more complex Proof of Personhood function to be built into smart contracts. These applications can use privacy-preserving AI to do the necessary verification a contract requires, and the results of this verification can be posted on the ledger in order to boost the reliability and integrity in the proof's verification process. There is already immense interest in the space for this technology, with a few major use cases being democratic voting, representation in DAOs, interactions in the Metaverse, distribution of DeFi rewards, and building decentralized social media user bases.
