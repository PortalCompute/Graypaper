# Use Cases
> Portal enables all kinds of new applications. Here we describe some that we think are industry changing and positive for society.

## Portal allows for

1. new use cases that were **not previously possible**: [proof of AI](https://whitepaper.portalcompute.com/use_cases/proof_of_ai), [ethical AI](https://whitepaper.portalcompute.com/use_cases/ethical_ai), [AI marketplaces](https://whitepaper.portalcompute.com/use_cases/ai_marketplace).

2. existing use cases to be made **practical**: [collaborative training](https://whitepaper.portalcompute.com/use_cases/collaborative_training), [electronic health records](https://whitepaper.portalcompute.com/use_cases/ehr).

3. **new capabilities** for existing Dapps: [sybil resistance](https://whitepaper.portalcompute.com/use_cases/sybil_resistance), [DeFi](https://whitepaper.portalcompute.com/use_cases/defi), [recommender systems](https://whitepaper.portalcompute.com/use_cases/recommender_sys), [non-custodial biometrics](https://whitepaper.portalcompute.com/use_cases/biometrics), [private nfts](https://whitepaper.portalcompute.com/use_cases/private_nfts).
