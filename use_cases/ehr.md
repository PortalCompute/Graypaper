# Electronic Health Records
![](../gifs/electronic_health_records.gif)
> Blockchain based AIs democratize access to healthcare recommendations. Smartphone-enabled hospitals can use Portal to perform life-saving classifications while protecting patient privacy. 

> For example, a hospital in a developing country without the resources to fund a team of data scientists can access AI to detect life-threatening tumors in MRI scans. This is enabled via the ubiquity of blockchains, and the minimal requirements from users to interface with our oracle services.

> For more detail on how Portal can revolutionize healthcare AI, see [proof of AI](https://whitepaper.portal3.ai/use_cases/proof_of_ai).
