# IOT
![Workflow](../gifs/iot_marketplace.gif)
> IOT devices are growing increasingly pervasive and interconnected. Whether a wearable device (smart watches and rings) monitoring your vitals, a smart appliance (lights, cameras, locks, air conditioners, etc) automating your home life, or a smart device controlling other devices (voice assistants), IOT devices are producing value for users.  

> At the same time, these devices are generating vast amounts of highly personalized data. Unfortunately, the status quo is surveillance. This personal and sensitive data does not remain in the custody of the users from whom it was generated. Instead, others profit on this data at the expense of user privacy.

> Blockchains specializing in IOT have made it possible to bring IOT data to the chain, and the emergence of blockchain-based data marketplaces have made it possible to sell data without sacrificing privacy. However, without demand for this data, this combination isn't enough to move the needle. 

> We think that Portal's AI services are the missing piece in this equation. It is now possible to perform meaningful analytics on this vast IOT data without compromising privacy. AI developers can train impactful models, creating demand for IOT data, while also creating valuable services. 

> For example, users can **opt-in** to sell their encrypted health data from wearable devices to data marketplaces. This is already a stark difference from the status quo where the only option is to opt-out of using the device entirely. AI developers can purchase this health data to train models to detect irregularities (i.e. [Atrial fibrillation](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/atrial-fibrillation/what-is-atrial-fibrillation-afib-or-af)). Users can then shop for AIs from an AI marketplace to get potentially life-saving analytics on their health data.

> This idea is not limited to healthcare AIs. Here are some potential use cases when applying AI to IOT data:

- proof of human:
    > prove that you are a human and not a bot (wearable health data is validated by AI to check for irregularities), unlocking many use-cases including sybil-resistance
- proof of sweat: 
    > prove that you have performed exercise (wearable health data is validated by AI to verify exercise threshold was reached)
- recurring health checks
    > run recurring analytics (i.e. every X blocks) on your health data. When used in conjunction with [proof of AI](https://whitepaper.portal3.ai/use_cases/proof_of_ai), this can be used in screening processes for medical insurance
- proof of alive
    > run recurring health checks on wearable health data to prove you are alive
- proof of location
    > use GPS data in conjunction with other sensor data prove your location (AI is used to detect fraud)
- privacy-preserving GPS navigation
    > can receive an optimal navigation route when driving, without disclosing your location to anyone (i.e. Google Maps)  
- live-to-earn
    > monetize all of your IOT data to receive passive income (without sacrificing privacy)
- smart cities
    > data collected from devices at the scale of a city can be analyzed to improve the experience of the city's residents
- proof of carbon footprint
    > AI can analyze data from IOT sensors in homes and buildings to determine a comprehensive carbon footprint score
