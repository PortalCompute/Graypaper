# Collaborative Learning/Analytics
![](../gifs/collaborative_training.gif)
> Portal allows users to specify who is allowed to participate when training a model. Since datasets are kept private, this allows for the joint training of a model without releasing sensitive data to collaborators. 

> This is an essential tool for enabling business-to-business and hospital-to-hospital collaborations. 

> DAO members can participate in the training of a DAO-owned model, where the dataset is curated to adhere to the community's values. For more detail see the [ethical AI](https://whitepaper.portal3.ai/use_cases/ethical_ai) use case.
